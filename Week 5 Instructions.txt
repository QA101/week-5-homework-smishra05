4. Coding exercises in Self coding folder 

5. Coding exercises in “SRC” folder
Instructions (READ FULLY):
The src folder has multiple classes with some inheritance. Short description:
* Store: represents a store which has multiple employees(only 1 manager)
* Employee: the base class from which Manager and Stocker should be extended from
* Manager: Should be extended from Employee. Has 1 additional method which hires new employees
* Stocker: Extended from Employee. Has 1 additional method which stocks selves.

Sadly, my code is buggy and you need to fix it. :) I have left TODO comments in the code for tasks that need to be completed.

Things to fix:
Store class:
* Store constructor creates a store with multiple employees, but a manager was never assigned to the store class. You need to set the manager correctly in the store constructor.
* Manager is trying to StockSelves in the main method. How can this be fixed?

Employee class
* Employee should override the toString method and print the name and salary of the employee

Manager class
* Manager is not extended from Employee correctly.

Stocker class:
* Nothing, this class works.


RECOMMENDATION:
Write down the relationship between employee, stocker, and manager before you start modifying the code


6. BONUS: Challenge coding (not required)
